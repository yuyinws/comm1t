# Introduce
There are lots of great open source projects on Github, Some times we want to see the begining of these project. 

Since these projects usually have thousands of commit, So I made this tool to find the first commit quickly.

# Usage
1. Open [comm1t.yuy1n.io](https://comm1t.yuy1n.io)
2. Input the repo's info
3. Click `Search` Button
4. Or just add repo's info after url, like this: [comm1t.yuy1n.io/microsoft/vscode](https://comm1t.yuy1n.io/microsoft/vscode)
